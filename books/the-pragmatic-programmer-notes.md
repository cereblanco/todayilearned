**My personal notes** on _The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas_
- highlights my favorite lines from the book
- lists some challenges (challenge(s)-to-self)
- doesn't include all the good stories in the book, i highly recommend read them yourself.

### Tip 1: Care About Your Craft
- "We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well."

### Tip 2: Think! About your work
- "Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time."
  
**Challenge-to-self:** Stop *just* copy pasting answers from the web. Understand the solution.

### Tip 3: Provide Options, Don't make lame excuses
- "Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation." 

### Tip 4: Don't live with broken window
- "One broken window, left un-repaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don't care about the building. "

**Challenge-to-self:** Fix that single broken window! don't let the sense of abandonment creep in

### Tip 5: Be a Catalyst for Change

Stone Soup
- Workout what you can initially ask for. Work it well. Show it off. Then slowly ask support for enhancements.

### Tip 6: Remember the Big Picture

Boiling Frog
- "Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing." 
 
**Challenge-to-self:** Are you a catalyst for good or bad change?

### Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue
- "The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specified as part of that system's requirements." Together with budget, time-of-development, user requirements, *quality* of the software should be also considered

- "Don't spoil a perfectly good program by over embellishment and over-refinement." Know when to stop.
- "Discipline yourself to write software that's good enough—good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind."
  
**Challenge-to-self:** Bugs exist! There's nothing like a "perfect" software.  But produce a "good enough" software.

### Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
- Regularly. Diversify. Manage risk. Buy low, sell high. Review and re-balance.

**Personalized challenge to myself**
- Read at least 3 technical article a day
- Read a non-technical article a day
- Read a technical book every quarter
- Learn new language a year
- enrol and finish your online classes you subscribed to
- find a mentor/join a network with similar interests as you
- practice what you learned

### Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

**Challenge-to-self:**
Don't just hear and accept. Analyze, Clarify, Ask questions (Do it politely), Look for answers yourself, Teach what you've learned.

### Tip 10: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
1. Know what you want to say. Outline
1. Know your audience
1. Speak at the right moment/situation
1. Choose a style. Is it formal, informal, bound reports, or simple memo
1. Make It Look Good; focus not only on the content, but also on it's delivery
1. Involve your audience
1. Be a listener. You listen, they listen.
1. Get back to people. Answer their inquiries, just how someone answers patiently your newbie inquiries

**Challenge-to-self:** Follow those stated above
